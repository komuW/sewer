## Sewer 0.8.3 Release Notes

This will attempt to list all the changes that affect users of the
`sewer-cli` program, including even cosmetic changes.  If you use sewer as a
library you may find internal changes not called out here.

**New `sewer-cli` features are usually just mentioned, see
[sewer-cli.md](sewer-cli) for more complete documentation.**

### What's New

- added many words in the /docs directory.  A lot of it is internals
  documentation; a lot of it was written to help me understand exactly how
  some things worked and decide how they should be improved - design essays,
  as it were.  Much of it is sure to still be in some intermediate state.

- new documentation of the [`sewer-cli` user command](sewer-cli).  Tries to
  be _as-is in 0.8.3_ while warning about things that are sure to change
  later.

- `--acme_timeout` has been added (revised from menduo's PR #154)

- `alias` parameter (in DNSProviderBase) added; available through `--p_opt
  alias=...` for `sewer-cli`.  **NB: legacy drivers do NOT implement
  aliasing yet - code changes req'd**

- `prop_delay`, `prop_timeout` and `prop_sleep_times` (in DNSProviderBase)
  Available through the `--p_opt` option in `sewer-cli`, though no legacy
  provider has support for `prop_timeout` or `prop_sleep_times`.  One
  advantage to the `--p_opt` approach is that these parameters *will* be
  available to any provider that supports them (and likewise, other future
  additions) without any change to `sewer-cli`.

**NB: `--alias_domain` and the planned `--prop_*` options were only added
during PRE-0.8.3, so they will just be dropped in the release.**

### What's Changed

Mostly I've tried to avoid changes that were likely to break things.  More
so for `sewer-cli` than those who use the inner workings of Client, of
course.

- the default log level for providers changed from INFO to WARNING,
  so by default they don't natter so much.  Makes `sewer-cli` a little quieter
  when there are no problems.

- all the legacy DNS providers have been minimally revised to accept some
  new options and pass them up to their parent classes.

- `sewer-cli` interface to providers has been augmented to pass some new options
  (--acme_timeout, parameters from --p_opts)

- `sewer-cli` has had long option abbreviations disabled in argparse.  This
  was never documented in sewer, and is an attractive nuisance since the
  addition of another option can break an abbreviation.  Everyone wants more
  options, right?  <wink>

- `unbound_ssh` driver, a working demonstration of using aliasing support in
  a legacy DNS driver.  Needs a rather specific environment to work, but I
  just renewed a handful of certificates using it the other day.

- JSON configuration has arrived.  sewer.json replaces __version__.py.
  catalog.json adds a central description of known drivers, replacing the
  mess of imports [removed], some non-DRY lists in setup.py and cli.py.

- `sewer.catalog` provides loading of the JSON catalog as well as methods to
  lookup the descriptor and load the module; replaces the mess of imports

### Breakage

- removed all the imports in __init__.py (both sewer & dns_providers).  This
  *will* affect you if you've just done `import sewer` and access especially
  the provider classes as eg.  `sewer.ThatDNSDns`.  ~~Using proper imports,
  eg., `import sewer.dns_providers.thatdns.ThatDNSDns` is the current
  workaround, sorry.~~  Recommended use is now something like
  ```
  from sewer import catalog

  pro_cls = catalog.ProviderCatalog().get_provider("route53")
  provider = pro_cls(...arguments as needed...)

  # use of route53 is ironic: it has no catalog entry because it has
  # never been integrated into `sewer-cli`, which was what drove the
  # creation of the catalog  [right, another FIX ME]
  ```
  **This does NOT affect `sewer-cli` users.**

### Deprecated

- `--action {run,renew}` option has never actually had any effect and is no
  longer required (since 0.8.2?).  LOGS A WARNING IN 0.8.3.
