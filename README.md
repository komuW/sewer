## Sewer

**Cryptography rework branch.**

The story so far:
- the mixed openssl/cryptography libraries using code has all been ripped
out of client.py
- AcmeKey and AcmeCsr, in crypto.py, replace and extend (ECDSA keys) old code
- Client NO LONGER GENERATES KEYS (account or certificate)
- Client argument changes:
  + acct_key:AcmeKey in place of account_key: str
  + cert_key:AcmeKey in plaxe of certificate_key: str
  + bits: int removed
  + is_new_account:bool [False] if key requires registration
- CLI options have changed a bit, mostly to add new features (ECDSA keys!)
  + acct_key/cert_key added, preferred over account_key/certificate_key
  + acct_key_type/cert_key_type allow selection of RSA or EC key generation
  + is_new_account added to support registering your own account key

Sewer is a Let's Encrypt(ACME) client.  
It's name is derived from Kenyan hip hop artiste, Kitu Sewer.  

- This is crypto work, intended for the 0.8.4 release.  No notes yet.
- The stable release is [0.8.3](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/notes/0.8.3-notes).
- More history in the [CHANGELOG](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/CHANGELOG).

> 0.8.4 will bring more changes, especially if you use sewer's Client class
directly.  The command line offers more opportunities to hide internal
changes.

> CLI changes from 0.8.3: `--action` is still accepted but deprecated. 
Likewise `--dns`, replaced by `--provider`.  Some new options have been
added.

PYTHON compatibility: 3.5 is nominally still supported, and with assistance
from Github's multi-version Python linting I've repaired some issues.  Even
with the GH multi-version testing, there are parts of the drivers,
especially, which I simply can't test (with 3.5) because the actual service
provider interaction has to be mocked.  Such issues will be fixed on a
best-effort basis when reported for the life of 0.8.

I (maintainer @mmaney) loiter in channel ##sewer (on irc.freenode.net) for
those who remember IRC.  Don't ask to ask!

## Features
- Obtain or renew SSL/TLS certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
- Supports acme version 2 (current RFC including post-as-get).
- Support for SAN certificates.
- Supports [wildcard certificates](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/wildcards).
- Bundling certificates.
- Supports [DNS and HTTP](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/UnifiedProvider) challenges
  - List of currently supported
    [DNS services and BYO-service notes](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/dns-01)
  - HTTP challenges are a new feature, no operational drivers in the tree
    yet.  [See usage and BYO-service notes](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/http-01)
- sewer is both a [command-line program](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/sewer-cli)
  and a [Python library](https://komuw.github.io/sewer/sewer-as-a-library) for custom use
- Well written(if I have to say so myself):
  - [Good test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/komuW/sewer)
  - [Passing continuous integration](https://circleci.com/gh/komuW/sewer)
  - [High grade statically analyzed code](https://www.codacy.com/app/komuW/sewer/dashboard)
  - type hinting to support mypy verification is a recently begun WIP

```

sewer(since version 0.5.0) is now python3 only.  To install the (now
unsupported) python2 version:

```shell
pip install sewer==0.3.0
```

Sewer is in active development and it's API will change in backward incompatible ways.

## FAQ
- Why another ACME client?          
  I wanted an ACME client that I could use to programmatically(as a library) acquire/get certificates. However I could not 
  find anything satisfactory for use in Python code.
- Why is it called Sewer?
  I really like the Kenyan hip hop artiste going by the name of Kitu Sewer.
